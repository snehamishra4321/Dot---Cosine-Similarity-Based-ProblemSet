A problem set on Dot &amp; Cosine similarity based problem set <br>

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. Cosine similarity is better than dot similarity because it takes into account the magnitude of the vectors and is not affected by the size of the vectors. Dot similarity is only concerned with the angle between the two vectors and is affected by the size of the vectors.
